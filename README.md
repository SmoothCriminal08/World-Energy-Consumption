# Introduction 

World energy consumption is an important feature of contemporary civilization since it supports human activities such as transportation, heating and cooling, and power generation. Energy consumption has risen in tandem with global population and economic expansion, resulting in severe environmental consequences such as greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. To comprehend the magnitude of energy consumption and encourage sustainable energy practices, it is crucial to use visualization tools that aid in promoting awareness and action.

# Problem Statement

# Objectives
1) To investigate the scale of energy consumption around the world.
2) To understand the trends of energy consumption using data visualization tools such as graph and pie chart.
3) To promote awareness and action towards sustainable energy use around the world.

# Analysis
The aim of analyzing energy consumption is to comprehend how energy is used and where it originates from in order to discover possibilities for improving efficiency, minimizing expenditure, and reducing environmental consequences. Hence, more informed and better understanding decisions about energy usage and its investments can be made by policymakers, corporations, and people.

There are several key purposes analyzing energy consumptions with the most important key which is to identify trends and patterns. Over the time, the data of energy consumption has shown an increase in pattern steadily, driven by population growth, economic development, and urbanization. To simply put, this analyzed data can be used not just to forecast future energy consumption but to identify locations where energy-saving measures might be implemented.

Moreover, these data may be used to make improvements in terms of energy efficiency. The analysis of energy consumptions can help with detecting areas where energy efficiency solutions are needed.  Hence, this implementation of the solution will give impact in minimizing energy usage and lower the expenses of a country especially for the expenditure for the non renewable energy used.
